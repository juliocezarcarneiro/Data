# Predicting Gentrification

This thought experiment will explore **gentrification**, a social phenomenon where affluent people move to lower-income neighborhoods.

## Instructions

In your groups, discuss the following questions:

* What signs might indicate that gentrification is happening?
- Property values and rent increase.
- Renovations and construction.
- New restaurants and cafes.

* What means can we use to determine how long the trend has been happening?
- Residents can no longer afford to stay in their homes due the rising housing costs.
- Apps to see property values comparing with household income.

* What proxies might we use to identify gentrification in nonobvious ways?
- Increased usage of deliveries services.
- House cleaning companies.
- Increase of jobs around the area.
- Safety calls.

* How might you create a visualization of this data to best “tell the story”?
- Line Graphs showing the trends like rent increases and business and commercial activity.

Pay special attention to details like:

* What data will you use to build your model?
- Population growth or decline.
- Number and types of new businesses.

* How will you retrieve the data?
- Census data.
- Open Government Surveys and Reports.

* What is your final “story”?
